## Instructions

[Lesson](https://learn.udacity.com/nd772?version=1.0.9&partKey=cd14600&lessonKey=4f64d351-9b88-4b10-b845-8b3710a3c485&conceptKey=dc777f93-4f0b-424e-b650-a8ecca11c94c&tab=lesson)

## Project Instructions

You will start with a provided skeleton codebase and implement core components using classic object-oriented design patterns. The project requires you to apply three required patterns and one additional pattern of your choice. Each pattern must be implemented in Python and integrated into the working finance manager application.

### Required Steps

Required Steps

#### 1\. Implement a Singleton Balance class

Ensure only one instance of the balance manager exists across the application using the Singleton pattern.

#### 2\. Complete the Transaction class

Finish the Transaction class using an enum to represent the transaction type (INCOME, EXPENSE).

#### 3\. Implement the Adapter pattern

Complete a TransactionAdapter class that converts external freelance income (with invoice ID and project details) into a compatible Transaction object.

#### 4\. Implement the Observer pattern

Create and register a LowBalanceAlertObserver that gets notified and triggers an alert when the user’s balance falls below a defined threshold and PrintBalance Observer that gets triggered when there is a change in the balance.

#### 5\. Choose and Implement One Additional Pattern (Student’s Choice)

You will select one additional design pattern to implement from the course curriculum:

Students must document:

- Why they chose this pattern
- Where it fits into the app
- How it improves flexibility, testability, or scalability

#### 6\. Write Unit Tests

Create unit tests for the Balance, Transaction, Adapter, Observer, and any custom pattern implementation.

#### 7\. Run and Demonstrate the Application

Use the provided main.py script to simulate the app.

#### 8\. Reflect and Document

Include a short reflection explaining:

- The four design patterns used
- How each improved the design
- Any trade-offs encountered during implementation

## Submission Instructions

If you’d like to work on the project locally, you can clone the repository and submit your solution by sharing a link to your GitHub repo. Please include a brief reflection either in the README file or as a separate text file in the repo. Alternatively, you can use the provided workspace to complete the project and submit it directly there.
